name: flowing
description: Runs a multi-step procedure as a Python DAG, so ordering, branching and retries are enforced by the runner rather than described in prose a model can generate past. Use for "run these steps in order and retry the flaky one until the check passes", "build a pipeline that fetches, validates, then skips the upload when nothing changed", "make sure these steps cannot be skipped", "resume from where it broke instead of redoing the expensive early stages", "run these independent calls at once and merge the results", or any procedure of 3+ steps with branches, input contracts, or side effects that must not block the critical path. Primitives are depends_on, when=, validate=, retry_until=, detached= and journal_path=. Not for a single sequential call, for steps needing reasoning between them that no predicate captures, or for async and distributed work. To audit whether one verification check can actually go red, use gating. To fan work out across many subagents, use a dynamic workflow.

## NOT SUPERSEDED BY DYNAMIC WORKFLOWS — read first

Claude Code's dynamic workflows orchestrate **subagents** (separate contexts,
fan-out to 16-concurrent / 1000-agent). This skill is a **different primitive**:
single-context control flow over YOUR OWN tool calls, with durable side-effects
and checkpoint resume. The workflows runtime explicitly cannot touch the
filesystem or shell directly — its agents do the work and the script only
coordinates them. Flowing is the inverse: the script does the work.

Use flowing for an in-context pipeline (3+ steps, branches, retries, validation,
detached side-effects). Use a workflow when you need many subagents. They compose;
they do not compete. Do not abandon flowing for a workflow — you would lose the
durable side-effects and the cross-session checkpoint that hub-spoke depends on.

# Flowing — Control Flow in Code, Not Prose

When a procedure needs 3+ steps with branches, retries, or contracts, encode it as a DAG of Python tasks instead of prose imperatives. Prose like "first X, then Y, then if Z retry 3×" is read and generated past. A `@task` graph is structural: a step physically cannot run until its inputs are bound, and gates that fire on bad inputs can't be skipped.

The runner owns control flow — branching, retrying, validating, propagating failures, parallelizing. You provide judgment at the leaves. Runner: `scripts/flowing.py`.

## Quick Start

```python
from flowing import task, Flow

@task
def fetch_data():
    return {"items": [1, 2, 3]}

@task(depends_on=[fetch_data])
def process(fetch_data):          # param name must match the dep's name
    return sum(fetch_data["items"])

@task(depends_on=[process])
def store(process):
    print(f"Result: {process}")

Flow(store).run()                 # topo-sorts, runs each layer, parallel within a layer
```

Each task receives its dependencies as kwargs named after them. Independent tasks in the same layer run in parallel.

## Control-Flow Primitives

Encode branches and contracts as graph structure, not `if` statements inside task bodies.

### `when=` — conditional gate

Run the task only if the predicate (over gathered dep values) is truthy. Falsy → SKIPPED, and the skip propagates to dependents.

```python
@task(depends_on=[fetch], when=lambda fetch: fetch["needs_processing"])
def process(fetch):
    return transform(fetch["payload"])
```

### `validate=` — edge contract

Check gathered dep values before the body runs. Raise → FAILED with **no retry** (bad inputs don't fix themselves). Pass → proceed.

```python
def must_have_items(fetch):
    if not fetch.get("items"):
        raise ValueError("fetch returned empty payload")

@task(depends_on=[fetch], validate=must_have_items)
def process(fetch):
    return sum(fetch["items"])
```

### `retry_until=` — predicate-driven loop

Run the body, then call `retry_until(value)`. True → done. False → retry, consuming the `retry=` budget. Use for self-correcting LLM steps: generate, check, regenerate.

```python
@task(retry=4, retry_until=lambda r: r["valid"])
def generate_until_valid():
    candidate = llm_call(...)
    return {"valid": passes_schema(candidate), "candidate": candidate}
```

Distinct from `retry=` alone, which only retries on a raised exception.

## Other capabilities

- **Parallel execution** — independent tasks in a layer run on a thread pool (`max_workers=`).
- **`detached=True`** — side-effect tasks (memory writes, notifications) that run after the main DAG and never block it on failure.
- **In-process resume** — `flow.run()` → fix → `flow.resume()` re-runs from the failure point, keeping succeeded tasks cached **in memory** (same process only). `flow.override(task, value)` injects a corrected result.
- **Durable journal (`journal_path=`)** — opt-in content-addressed replay that survives container death. `Flow(term, journal_path="/path/run.jsonl").run()` appends each succeeded task's result to an append-only JSONL keyed by a `step_key` = SHA-256 over the task's bytecode + its `when`/`validate`/`retry_until` bodies + its dependencies' keys (chained, so an upstream change propagates downstream). A later `run()` — even in a fresh container — replays the unchanged prefix from the journal and only executes tasks whose key is absent; editing a task body busts its key and re-runs it and its dependents, while cosmetic knobs (`retry=`, `timeout_s=`, `name`) do not. This is the cross-session checkpoint hub-spoke work relies on. Caveat: results are pickled, so non-picklable return values simply re-run; closure-captured values are not part of the key (only the task body's own code is).
- **`timeout_s=`**, **`retry=`** with exponential backoff, **`fail_fast=`**.

Read [references/reference.md](references/reference.md) before using anything beyond the quick start and the three primitives above — it covers every `@task` parameter, the `Flow` methods, resume/override, detached auto-discovery, and the `validate=`/`when=` signature-matching gotcha.

## When to use

- A procedure has branches that matter → `when=` makes them structural.
- Steps have input contracts → `validate=` makes them enforceable.
- An LLM step needs to converge → `retry_until=` puts the check in the loop.
- 3+ independent operations that can parallelize.
- Multi-step pipelines where late failures shouldn't waste early work.
- Side-effects that shouldn't block the critical path → `detached=True`.

## When NOT to use

- A single sequential operation — just call the function.
- The next step needs *reasoning* about the prior result that can't be a predicate — use a think loop.
- Async or distributed workflows — this is single-container, thread-pool based.

## Authoring discipline

If you find yourself writing prose like *"first call X, validate Y, then if Z retry up to 3 times"* — that is a flowing graph. Refactor before shipping. Prose imperatives don't enforce; `@task` graphs do.
